Addresses
=============

## Get information about distance given two addresses.


### How to run locally the Application?
1. Verify you have installed Node.js before to run the app, works well on v12.13.0, check version with `node -v`. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies - only the first time you build the app-.
3. Place your own csv file called AddressInput.csv with the addresses you want to calculate the distance on root. 
4. Run `npm start` to run the process.
5. At the end, process will create AddressesOutput.csv file on root with data ordered by distance given reference indicated in the file.

### Csv Input file
AddressInput.csv file should be present on root and should have the following format:

| Name            | Address          | City         | Country   |
|-----------------|------------------|--------------|-----------|
| Origin          | Av. Italia 6201  | Montevideo   | Uruguay   |
| Johannes Kepler | Av. Brasil 3090  | Maldonado    | Uruguay   |
| Marie Curie     | 18 de julio 1249 | Buenos Aires | Argentina |
| Herman Hesse    | Mones Roses 6937 |              |           |

- Values are separated by `,` and the file should have a header with the columns names detailed.
- `Name` and `Address` are mandatory fields, `City` and `Country` are optional.
- Row with `Name = Origin` will be considered the reference to calculate distance from others points.

### How its works?
- The API used to Geolocate addresses is [Nominatim](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/ui/search.html) from the [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=12/-34.8083/-56.1453). Geolocate is a process to find the geographic location of an object in the world.
- The way distance is calculated is using the [Haversine formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula).
  - By the way it works, formula will underestimate distances in some situations. 
    - E.g.: From London Eye to the Korean War Memorial, using haversine distance you would think itâ€™s only 300 metres away. However, once you account for the Thames in the middle and decide you will not try to swim through it, youâ€™ll find that the distance is actually three times what you thought, 900 metres.
- WIP to replace the Haversine formula to use [Open Source Routing Machine](https://project-osrm.org/) to calculate the distance and avoid the underestimation of the distance.
